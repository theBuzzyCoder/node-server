# node-server

A web server written purely in nodejs.

This application is written in nodejs without using any npm modules. Every single block of code is built using node library functions. No external framework used.

The idea is not to use external npm modules and write the server using nodejs only.

## Requirements

- nodejs
- openssl

## Features Built (So far)

- An HTTP/HTTPS server
- Hello World
- (API only) Ability to create a user, update user information, read user information and delete user.

Note: This application doesn't have a front end yet.
